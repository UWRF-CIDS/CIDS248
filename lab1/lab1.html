<h1>Linux Tutorial One</h1>
<h3>Typographical conventions</h3>
<p>In what follows, we shall use the following typographical conventions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Characters written 
  <code>like this</code> are commands to be typed into the computer as they stand.</li>
  <li>Characters written 
  <code>
    <i>like this</i>
  </code>indicate non-specific file or directory names.</li>
  <li>Words inserted within square brackets (e.g. 
  <code>[Ctrl]</code>) indicate keys to be pressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for example,</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls 
  <i>anydirectory</i>[Enter]</code>
</p>
<p>means "at the Linux prompt % (or $ on our system), type ls followed by the name of some directory, then press the key marked Enter"</p>
<p>Don't forget to press the [Enter] key: commands are not sent to the computer until this is done.</p>
<h3>UNIX/Linux is case-sensitive</h3>
<p class="hint">Note: UNIX is case-sensitve, so LS is not the same as ls. 
<br />
<br />The same applies to filenames, so myfile.txt, MyFile.txt and MYFILE.TXT are three seperate files. Beware if copying files to a PC, since DOS and Windows do not make this distinction.</p>
<h3>1.1 Listing files and directories</h3>
<p>When you first open a terminal, your current working directory is often your home directory. Your home directory has the same name as your user-name, and it is where your personal files and subdirectories are saved.</p>
<p>To find out what is in your current working directory, type</p>
<p class="command">
<code>% ls</code>(ls is short for list)</p>
<p>The ls command lists the contents of your current working directory.</p>
<p>There may be no files visible in your home directory, in which case, the Linux prompt will be returned.</p>
<p>ls does not, in fact, cause all the files in your home directory to be listed, but only those ones whose name does not begin with a dot (.) Files beginning with a dot (.) are known as hidden files and usually contain important program configuration information. They are hidden because you should not change them unless you are very familiar with Linux!!!</p>
<p>To list all files in your home directory including those whose names begin with a dot, type</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls -a</code>
</p>
<p>ls is an example of a command which can take options: -a is an example of an option. The options change the behavior of the command. There are online manual pages that tell you which options a particular command can take, and how each option modifies the behavior of the command. (See later in this tutorial)</p>
<h3>1.2 Making Directories</h3>
<p>We will now make a subdirectory in your home directory to hold the files you will be creating and using in the course of this tutorial. To make a subdirectory called unixstuff in your current working directory type</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% mkdir unixstuff</code>
</p>
<p>To see the directory you have just created, type</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls</code>
</p>
<h3>1.3 Changing to a different directory</h3>
<p>The command cd directory means change the current working directory to 'directory'. The current working directory may be thought of as the directory you are in, i.e. your current position in the file-system tree.</p>
<p>To change to the directory you have just made, type</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% cd unixstuff</code>
</p>
<p>Type 
<code>ls</code>to see the contents (which should be empty)</p>
<h3>Exercise 1a</h3>
<p>Make another directory inside the 
<strong>unixstuff</strong>directory called 
<strong>backups</strong></p>
<h3>1.4 The directories . and ..</h3>
<p>Still in the 
<strong>unixstuff</strong>directory, type</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls -a</code>
</p>
<p>As you can see, in the 
<strong>unixstuff</strong>directory (and in all other directories), there are two special directories called (
<strong>.</strong>) and (
<strong>..</strong>)</p>
<p>In UNIX, (
<strong>.</strong>) means the current directory, so typing</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% cd .</code>
</p>
<p class="hint">NOTE: there is a space between cd and the dot</p>
<p>means stay where you are (the 
<strong>unixstuff</strong>directory).</p>
<p>This may not seem very useful at first, but using (
<strong>.</strong>) as the name of the current directory will save a lot of typing, as we shall see later in the tutorial.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>(
<strong>..</strong>) means the parent of the current directory, so typing</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% cd ..</code>
</p>
<p>will take you one directory up the hierarchy (back to your home directory). Try it now.</p>
<p>Note: typing cd with no argument always returns you to your home directory. This is very useful if you are lost in the file system.</p>
<h3>1.5 Pathnames</h3>
<p>Pathnames enable you to work out where you are in relation to the whole file-system. For example, to find out the absolute pathname of your home-directory, type 
<code>cd</code>to get back to your home-directory and then type</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% pwd</code>
</p>
<p>The full pathname will look something like this -</p>
<p>
  <strong>/home/username</strong>
</p>
<p>which means that 'username' (your home directory) is in the directory home. / is the "root" directory. To go to the root directory, you can use 
<strong>cd /</strong></p>
<h3>Exercise 1b</h3>
<p>Use the commands ls, pwd and cd to explore the file system.</p>
<p>Find the files named "passwd", "stdout",&#160; and "echo"?</p>
<p>(Remember, if you get lost, type cd by itself to return to your home-directory)</p>
<h3>1.6 More about home directories and pathnames</h3>
<p>First type cd to get back to your home-directory, then type</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls unixstuff</code>
</p>
<p>to list the contents of your unixstuff directory.</p>
<p>Now type</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls backups</code>
</p>
<p>You will get a message like this -</p>
<p class="stdout">backups: No such file or directory</p>
<p>The reason is, 
<strong>backups</strong>is not in your current working directory. To use a command on a file (or directory) not in the current working directory (the directory you are currently in), you must either cd to the correct directory, or specify its full pathname. To list the contents of your backups directory, you must type</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls unixstuff/backups</code>
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>~ (your home directory)</h3>
<p>Home directories can also be referred to by the tilde 
<strong>~</strong>character. It can be used to specify paths starting at your home directory. So typing</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls ~/unixstuff</code>
</p>
<p>will list the contents of your unixstuff directory, no matter where you currently are in the file system.</p>
<p>What do you think</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls ~</code>
</p>
<p>would list?</p>
<p>What do you think</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls ~/..</code>
</p>
<p>would list?</p>
<p>What do you think</p>
<p class="command">
  <code>% ls ~/.</code>
</p>
<p>would list?</p>
